NoMech
======

NoMech touch sensor board.
Based on the work of Kasbah.

Current developments:
- NoMech	4x4 board
- NoMech-8x8	8x8 board


You can buy the parts to build one through the [Kitspace page](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/kasbah/nomech).
The firmware is available in the [firmaware repo](https://github.com/kasbah/nomech_mini-code).

It would need some significant development to work robustly. Here is a demo of how far we got with it:
